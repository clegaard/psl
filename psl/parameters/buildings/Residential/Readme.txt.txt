For all residential buildings (Old, Reno, RenoLight) the graph of control inputs to contolled outputs is diagonal.
There are 6 zones in total.
For linear case there are 6 control inputs representing direct heat flows. 
	Mapping: i-th input affects i-th zone.
For nonlinear case, there are 12 control innputs 6 mass flows and 6 setpint temperatures for radiators.
	Mapping: for first 6 inputs i-th input affects i-th zone, for subsequent 6 inputs 6+i-th input affects i-th zone.
